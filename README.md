# FocusPatchers

A collection of standalone Synthesis patchers unrelated to easymod development.

Includes the following:

## Respect My Body (Slide)

Every BodySlide user knows and does not love the body overrides used in many follower mods, population mods and NPC overhauls. These custom bodies do not match the carefully-curated and custom-generated set of armors, outfits, textures, physics enhancers and other mods that they have painstakingly collected for in-game consistency. The result is neck seams, arm seams, bodies clipping through clothes, wacky physics, and even the occasional crash.

This patcher does one simple thing: remove them. After running this patcher, all NPCs will use the default body. If you are using a mod that replaces NPC hair via wigs, and the corresponding option is enabled (_Separate Wigs_), then instead of dereferencing the custom body entirely, it will try to patch the body so that it only replaces the hair and does not touch other parts.
